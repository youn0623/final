# Building My Portfolio 

## Intro
Building this portfolio was not too difficult because of the skills I have obtainined from the Web Development 2 course. With the information i have gained from that course i was able to use a lot of what i learned towards this website. Having also designed the layout of the website using Adobe XD before building this site made it much easier to tackle the layout of this website. 

## Planning
Building my website was a smooth process, thanks to a clear vision I had from the outset. This vision was solidified through a prototype I created in Adobe XD, which gave me a roadmap to follow.My aim was to highlight my specialized work and showcase my achievements in those areas. I wanted visitors to understand both what I've done and what I'm capable of.I pursued a simplistic style for the website while ensuring it also demonstrated my abilities. The website served a dual purpose: as a portfolio to display my projects, and as a portfolio piece in itself. This motivated me to add intricate details that showcased my attention to detail.Embracing a clean and understated aesthetic allowed my work to shine. The result is a website that reflects my skills and meticulous approach.
 
### Process
To build my portfolio website, I started with HTML. I created different sections for the content, aiming for a clean and modern look. I used Bootstrap to help with the design and make sure it worked well on all screen sizes.Once the layout was set, I filled in each section with details about my projects, added images, and made sure everything showed my skills and experiences clearly.

For styling, I turned to CSS. I used it to adjust things like text size, colors, and spacing. I also made sure the images looked good on any device by including different versions with different sizes. This made the website load faster and work well on phones and computers.To make things interesting, I added animations. Buttons and headings got some cool animations using a library called "animate.css." I also made skip links that wiggled using keyframes, which added a playful touch. I cared about making the website easy to use for everyone, so I added special tags and roles to help with accessibility. This makes the website work better for people who use screen readers or have other accessibility needs.

Lastly, in the footer of the website, I included a link to my Instagram. This way, visitors can connect with me beyond just the portfolio. In a nutshell, I used HTML for structure, Bootstrap for design, CSS for styling, and added animations and accessibility features. The result is a simple yet effective portfolio that showcases my work and who I am.

### Challenges/Solutions
While constructing my website using Bootstrap, I encountered challenges in styling certain elements effectively. Some of the elements didn't appear as I intended, with spacing and sizing seeming off. To address this, I had to delve into the "Inspect Element" feature of my browser. I discovered that some elements already had specific margins, sizing, or other settings that weren't immediately visible in the code. By inspecting these elements, I could see their existing styles and pinpoint what was causing the discrepancies. This gave me the insight needed to customize them better. I learned that I could modify these styles directly through my own CSS or by utilizing different Bootstrap classes to achieve the desired look and feel. This process of inspecting elements and making informed adjustments not only improved the visual appeal of my website but also deepened my understanding of Bootstrap's structure and customization capabilities.

### What I learned 
Discovering the convenience of Bootstrap has been a huge change in my coding experience. Its pre-designed components like cards and navigation bars have made building a website significantly smoother, sparing me from complex coding and providing a polished appearance. The simplified grid system in Bootstrap has also changed the way I arrange content across various screen sizes, replacing confusion with simplicity. One of the standout advantages has been the tremendous time savedâ€”by utilizing Bootstrap's ready-made structures, I've avoided the laborious process of crafting these elements from scratch, allowing me to focus more on refining my website's content and user experience.
